/*
  # Student Management System Database Schema

  1. New Tables
    - `cohorts`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)  
      - `name` (text)
      - `owner_id` (uuid, references auth.users)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `cohort_access`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `cohort_id` (uuid, references cohorts)
      - `user_id` (uuid, references auth.users)
      - `permissions` (text, 'view' or 'edit')
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `students`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `name` (text)
      - `leergroep` (integer, 1-3)
      - `photo_url` (text, nullable)
      - `cohort_id` (uuid, references cohorts)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for cohort owners and shared users
    - Secure student data access through cohort permissions

  3. Storage
    - Create student_photos bucket for photo storage
    - Set up policies for authenticated users
