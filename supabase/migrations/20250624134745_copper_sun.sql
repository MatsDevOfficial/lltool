  # Fix infinite recursion in cohorts RLS policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop the problematic "Users can view shared cohorts" policy that causes infinite recursion
    - Simplify the cohorts SELECT policies to avoid circular references
    - Keep the policy for users to view their own cohorts
    - Remove the circular dependency by handling shared cohorts access differently

  2. Changes Made
    - Drop existing SELECT policies on cohorts table
    - Create a single, simple SELECT policy for cohorts that only allows owners to see their cohorts
    - The shared cohorts access will be handled at the application level through joins
